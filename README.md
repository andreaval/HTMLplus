HTMLplus
==========
 HTMLplus is an unobtrusive script that adds useful features to HTML tag allowing webpages to maintain compatibility with all HTML/XHTML standards.

To add new features to the HTML standard, HTMLplus simply uses the class attribute. In general, the class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. HTMLplus uses this attribute to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class. Example: adding classname "blank" to the tag "A", the plugin will open the link in new page.

It's a plugin and requires jQuery library 1.3.2 and above to work. Tested on Internet Explorer 6/7/8, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Chrome.
